\section{Introduction}
Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation with broad utility in
electrostatics, mechanical engineering and theoretical phsyics.\cite{wiki}

\begin{align}
	\Nabla^2 \psi &= f \\
\end{align}

We are considering this problem on a scale from 0 to 1 in both x and y
direction with homogenouos dirichelet conditions amongst the edges, set to zero
in our case. 

\section{Solution strategies}
Given that we have a supercomputer at our hands we could be tempted to just
throw processing power on the problem untill it disappears, but a simple solver
based on Elementary linear algebra would be very slow compared to other
solutions. A solver using gaussian elimination would have a vector of unknowns being \emph{n} long
