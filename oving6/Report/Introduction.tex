\section{Introduction}
Poisson's equation is a partial differential equation with broad utility in
electrostatics, mechanical engineering and theoretical physics.\cite{wiki}

\begin{align}
	\Nabla^2 \psi &= f \\
\end{align}

We are considering this problem on a scale from 0 to 1 in both x and y
direction with homogenouos dirichelet conditions amongst the edges, set to zero
in our case.
