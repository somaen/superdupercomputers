\section{Kongull}

The distributed memory computer we ran our program on is called Kongull, it consists of 93 compute nodes that each have the following specs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 24/48 GiB RAM
    \item 2x6 Core AMD Opteron 2431, each with the following specs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2.4 GHz
        \item 6x 128 L1 Cache
        \item 6x 512 KiB L2 Cache
        \item 6 MiB L3 Cache
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each of these nodes has 2 CPUs, that share memory, thus we enjoy the combination of shared memory computing AND distributed memory while
running on this cluster.
