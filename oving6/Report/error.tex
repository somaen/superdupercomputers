\section{Errors}
Subsituting the formula in place of $f$ and comparing the result with the analytical answer yields us a difference we can compare to the expected convergence of the method. Table \ref{tab:relerr} shows that we have the convergence that we were after. 

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{\label{tab:relerr}Error in the differents resolutions lining up where we expect them to be. Multiplying the absolute error with the relative error correction, which matches a quadratic convergence in error, below gives near identical results for all resolutions. The function that were set in were -5 $\pi \sin(\pi x ) \sin(2\pi y)$ and it was compared to $\sin(\pi x ) \sin(2\pi y)$. }
