\section{Singlethreaded variant}
A simple program was written. It showed the expected behaviour, each iteration having about the double runtime of the last.
 This was  measured by using a timer     which we have removed from the code now to avoid too much clutter. We also chose to not optimise to make it a better baseline for comparison with the later programs.
