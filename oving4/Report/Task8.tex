\section{Attractiveness of parallelisation}
For problems in this category, that exhibit an optimal substructure, parallelisation seem highly desirable as you can serve each node a reduced set which it can solve and the problem depends on it. While this problem is trivial to solve using no extra memory we think problems in this category is desirable to parallelise.
