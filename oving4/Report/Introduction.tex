\section{Introduction}
Our languages of choice are D and C++, we therefore chose to meet on C for this assignment. 

We used pretty harsh compiler flags to be able to compile on all the machines we were using to code. This caused us to use quite a lot of casts, seen in our code, this might make it a bit harder to read, but it certainly helped us compile it and avoid a few mistakes.
